1.1  First release.   Tidied up code, started this change log.

1.2  10/02/02  Upgraded to allegro version 4, and a 21st century version of gcc.  Allegro v4 means we get various ports for free, but only DOS and Linux have been tested.

1.3 18/06/03:  This is primarily a bug fix release, released in a bit of a hurry due to the severity of some of the bugs reported!
Removed the BSD blurb from prot.txt (The "Obnoxious BSD Advertising Clause" has been officially voided).
Added some planets and things in the background.
Fixed (well, klugded around) the bug which made the game crash when quitting.
Tried to separate the platform-specific and platform-agnostic code.
Fixed the "Cheshire cat" bug - sometimes the bottoms of pods were not completely drawn over when they were picked up.
Fixed a bug in the high score table which caused a score deserving only tenth place to appear ninth.  (Thanks to Hugh Robinson for finding this bug)
Sorted out some of the keypress handling code.
Fixed some questionable coding style, which recent versions of DJGPP don't like.
Replaced all DOS LFs with unix CR/LFs - some versions of GCC didn't like dos-style returns and generated cryptic error messages. (Thanks to "Cone" for spotting this one) 

1.4 20/9/06:
Fixed a bug with sparks appearing in wierd places
Cleaned up code to deal with things that the latest versino of DJGPP didn't like
